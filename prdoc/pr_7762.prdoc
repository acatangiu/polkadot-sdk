title: ERC20 Asset Transactor

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      This PR introduces an Asset Transactor for dealing with ERC20 tokens and adds it to Asset Hub
      Westend.
      This means asset ids of the form `{ parents: 0, interior: X1(AccountKey20 { key, network }) }` will be
      matched by this transactor and the corresponding `transfer` function will be called in the
      smart contract whose address is `key`.
      If your chain uses `pallet-revive`, you can support ERC20s as well by adding the transactor, which lives
      in `assets-common`.

      This PR allows ERC20 tokens on Asset Hub to be referenced in XCM via their smart contract address.
      This is the first step towards cross-chain transferring ERC20s created on the Hub.
